A system has been successfully implemented and tested to provide full conventional assignment management for instructors (professors) solving all mentioned problems and issues both explicit and technical / legal.

AMS is fully documented both technically and in form of tutorials for instructors and for solvers. As demonstrated on two sample Java coding assignments and illustrated on several images, AMS is ready to be used for actual teaching.
