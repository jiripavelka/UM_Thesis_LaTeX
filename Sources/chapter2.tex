\chapter{Research Phase} \label{chap:research}

{The research chapter sums up the current state of the are beginning with current practices. Adding a set of so-called Web 2.0 concepts the next sections sums up various features into topics. Qualitative surveys (on those topics) with professors, students and other participants result in sets of features, summed up in a quantitative survey on levels of necessity.}

{Based on the survey, two sets of qualitative and functional requirements were established. The last section contains a comparison of 2 Ã— 10 most crucial qualitative and requirements across individual approaches from the state of the art chapter.}

\section{State of the Art (SOTA)} \label{sec:sota}

{There are multiple methods to distribute assignments between professors and students (instructors and solvers). Even with manual distributions, there are certain features that may be considered during surveys.}

\subsection{Manual Distribution Methods} \label{ssec:manual}

{The simplest way to distribute assignments is manually. There are various combinations of the following examples still being used in most universities by the time this research was taking place in 2020.}

\subsubsection{Manual downloads}

{Professor publishes course materials online together with assignment instructions including coding script templates or framework. Students download the assignment files manually (file by file) preserving the original folder structure.}

\subsubsection{Manual uploads}

{Students obtain course-specific credentials (username and password). They upload their solutions using SCP or similar (proprietary) commands.}

\subsubsection{Email attachments}

{Students are asked to send their (zipped) solution to a professor's email address.}

\subsubsection{Working code printouts}

{Some professors are asking their students to print out their }{coding}{~assignments and deliver physically into their office or mailbox.}

\subsubsection{Testing Scripts}

{Some professors use semi-automated testing for their personal use or publicly. Scripts are usually just a set of various assignment usages and expected results. Therefore they need to be run and often evaluated manually. Usually either the solution or tests need to be adjusted to be applicable.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  {limited semi-automated testing}
\item
  {run and evaluated manually by professors, sometimes also by students}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Grading Services}

{Gradescope\footnote{https://gradescope.com} is a tool designed to streamline and standardize paper-based, digital, and code assignments. It supports problem sets and projects as well as worksheets, quizzes, exams, and papers.}

{Some professors tend to create their own proprietary online submission services, such as Progtest\footnote{http://progtest.fit.cvut.cz}. Students get an immediate evaluation upon (manual) submission and professors gain collective classification.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  {Students upload their solution into an online ``black box'' system.}
\item
  {The system evaluates their solution and provides results and submission history.}
\item
  {The system can limit submissions in time or attempts.}
\item
  {Score based on test results.}
\item
  {Bonus point for early delivery.}
\item
  {Plagiarism check.}
\item
  {Compilation test.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Online File Systems}

{Online file systems, such as Google Drive or Workspace, MS OneDrive, Box, are meant to store and share documents and general files. For the sake of assignments, online file systems are commonly used strictly for submitting (uploading) solutions.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  {store and share files online,}
\item
  {synchronize with local file system (platform specific)}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Learning Management Systems} \label{ssec:lms}
